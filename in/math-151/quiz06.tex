::: Quiz 6

# 1
Determine convergence or divergence, including absolute/conditional convergence
if applicable. State clearly what test is being used.
\[\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n\sqrt{\ln n}}\]
===
(Integral test) Because \(\lim=\infty\) the series diverges.

---

# 2
Determine convergence or divergence, including absolute/conditional convergence
if applicable. State clearly what test is being used.
\[1+\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{4}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{9}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{16}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{25}}+\cdots\]
===
(P-series) Because \(p=\sfrac{2}{3}<1\) the series diverges.

---

# 3
Determine convergence or divergence, including absolute/conditional convergence
if applicable. State clearly what test is being used.
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{{(-1)}^{n+1}}{\sqrt{n}}\]
===
Converges conditionally.

---

# 4
Find the interval of convergence for the power series
\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{{(-1)}^n{(x+1)}^n}{2^n}\]
===
(-3,1)
